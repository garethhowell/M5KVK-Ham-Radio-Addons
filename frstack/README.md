# FRStack add-on for Home Assistant

This is a simple addon that runs the [FRStackWebApi.dll][API] code produced by
[Mark Hanson - W3II][W3II] of [MKCM Software][MKCM].
FRStackWebAPI allows a ham to control a Flex radio using a [REST][REST] API.
See the [README][API] on the [MKCM Website][MKCM] for more details.
