# Home Assistant Add-on: FRStack

## Installation

To install the add-on, follow the instruction steps from the [README on GitHub][README]

[README]: https://github.com/garethhowell/M5KVK-Ham-Radio-Addons/blob/main/frstack/README.md

## Configuration

This is a very simple addon that (currently) requires very little configuration.

The only item to set is the port on which the API listens.
It defaults to 5025.

## In Use

Once running, the add-on shouldn't need to be touched.
All the action takes place on the client accessing the API.

This is best understood by viewing the [README][API] on the [MKCM Software site][MKCM]
